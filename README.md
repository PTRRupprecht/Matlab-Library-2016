# Matlab-Library-2016
Matlab Ca imaging data analysis library 2016

A messy compilation of Matlab scripts that I use for alignment of Ca imaging data, ROI-based analysis (manually) and further analysis of extracted time courses of dF/F data based on correlations, spatial clustering, mutual information, etc.
Mostly intended for private use without nice commenting.
